Project: Rock-Paper-Scissors

About: Created a GUI to play the game Rock-Paper-Scissors game in the web browser.

This is my first web broswer based game - my solution to the Rock, Paper, Scissor project from The Odin Project.

In this project I created a page layout with html, decorating and positioning the divs using css, and creating functional buttons with updated scores output with javascript.
